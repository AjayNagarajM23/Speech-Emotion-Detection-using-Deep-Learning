# Speech-Emotion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

This system is designed to detect the emotion of a speaker based on their speech. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze the audio signal and classify it into one of several emotion categories (e.g. happy, sad, angry, neutral).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip
- virtualenv (optional)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/AjayNagarajM23/Speech-Emotion-Detection-using-Deep-Learning.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd speech-emotion-detection`
3. Create a virtual environment (optional): `virtualenv venv`
4. Activate the virtual environment (if using one): `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install the requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Built With

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) - The machine learning library used
- [Librosa](https://librosa.org/) - The audio processing library used
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - The machine learning library used
- [Keras](https://keras.io/) - The high-level neural network API used

### Datasets

This project uses the following datasets:

- RAVEDESS: The Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (RAVDESS) is a dataset containing speech and song recordings of actors expressing different emotions.

- SAVEE: The Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE) dataset is a collection of audio recordings of actors expressing different emotions.

- CREMA-D: The CREMA-D dataset is a collection of audio recordings of actors expressing different emotions, as well as corresponding annotations of facial expressions and other contextual information.

- TESS: The Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS) is a dataset containing audio recordings of actors expressing different emotions.
